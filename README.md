# Traction

A simple streak tracker to build and maintain daily habits.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Set up the database: `bin/rails db:setup`
4. Start the server: `bin/rails server`
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Motivation

I've always wanted a super simple streak tracker that's not distracting and where you can access the raw data. This project is my attempt to build something like that, and explore Ruby on Rails at the same time.
